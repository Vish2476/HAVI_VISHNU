### The solution begins her
## I have designed a PHP+Mysql application and Django(Python framework) Application

initially we do start by creating the database in PHPMYADMIN by adding the file inside <a href="https://github.com/Vish2476/HAVI_VISHNU/blob/main/database/">Database</a> folder 
</hr>
next we do start the XAMPP or related PHP server and run the <a href="https://github.com/Vish2476/HAVI_VISHNU/blob/main/index.php">Index.php</a>
as the registartion and login will be done if the database is set properly now we can use a small TODO application under the user 
![TODO](https://github.com/Vish2476/HAVI_VISHNU/blob/main/images/todo_user.png?raw=true) 
for the admin functions we will go to <a href="https://github.com/Vish2476/HAVI_VISHNU/blob/main/admin/">/admin</a>
<br>
now the admin credentials for this program is 
- username : admin
- password : password
